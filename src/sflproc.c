    Function: process_create_full

    Synopsis: Creates a subprocess and returns a PROCESS identifying the new
    process.  Optionally redirects standard input, output, error file handles
    to supplied file handles, changes working directory, and environment.
    In some operating systems can also optinally change the root directory
    (chroot()), and the uid/gid with which the new process runs.
    All information required to start the new process is specified in a
    PROCESS_DATA structure.  Where elements are not specified, they remain the
    same as the current process.  The following elements can be specified
    in the PROCESS_DATA structure:
    <Table>
    filename      File to execute, can include arguments if argv is NULL.
    argv_[]       List of arguments; argv [0] is filename; ends in a NULL.
    path          Search path (environments PATH is used if NULL).
    shell         Shell to use if useshell is TRUE (default is OS specific)
    searchext     Array of extensions to search when looking for filename
    searchpath    Flag: TRUE indicates path should be searched for filename
    useshell      Flag: TRUE indicates program should be started via a shell
    createdaemon  Flag: TRUE indicates a (separate) daemon should be started
    wait          Flag: TRUE indicates wait for process to finish
    delay         Amount of time to wait around for errors to happen (unix)
    rootdir       Root directory for new process (chroot()) if not NULL
    workdir       Working directory; if NULL, remains in current directory.
    in            File handle to use for standard input; -2 = no redirection.
    out           File handle to use for standard output; -2 = no redirection.
    err           File handle to use for standard error; -2 = no redirection.
    no_handles    Number of file handles to pass to child process (default: 3)
    envv_[]       Whole environment for new process; if NULL current env used
    envadd        Strings to add into current environment (if envv NULL).
    envrm         Keys to remove from current environment (if envv NULL).
    username      user name under which to run process
    groupname     groupname associated with user name
    password      required if calling process is not privileged
    </Table>
    If argv is NULL, parses the filename argument into words delimited by
    whitespace and builds the necessary argv table automatically.  Use this
    feature to execute a command with arguments, specified as one string.
    To search for the program in the path set searchpath to TRUE, and
    optionally supply a path to search.  To run shell builtins set useshell
    to TRUE.
    The envv list consists of strings in the form "name=value", ending in a
    NULL pointer.  If the envv argument is null, the environment of the
    current process is passed, with additions from envadd (if not NULL),
    and the keys listed in envrm removed (if not NULL).  If envv is not null
    then the envv environment is used as is.
    The child process may optionally start in a new root directory and with
    a different user/group (if supported by the operating system).  If rootdir,
    workdir, user, and group are all non null, then they are processed in the
    order: rootdir, workdir, group, user, to ensure all changes take place.
    Note that in this instance workdir is relative to the new root directory.
    Under DOS, Windows, and OS/2, the rootdir may be used to specify a change
    to a new drive letter (processed by _chdir() or _chdir2()).
    If the child command detects an error
    at startup, it may exit with an error status.  The sleep allows this
    error to be collected by calling process_status() after this call.
    Returns child process id, or 0 if there was an error.  The PROCESS_DATA
    structure contains the following fields used for output:
    <Table>
    pid           Process identifier (as returned by function)
    returncode    Return code from sub process (only set if wait is TRUE)
    error         Code indicating error that occured (like libc errno)
    </Table>
    Under VMS, the filename must have been defined as a command before the
    calling process was started; the path is disregarded.
    Under Windows and OS/2 processing of the #! line is emulated, and the
    interpreter mentioned in the #! line will be invoked on the script.
    Under OS/2 the filename can be the name of a CMD script, and this will
    be run with the interpreter specified in the first line (EXTPROC line,
    or "'/'*!" line; or failing that with the default command interpreter.

    Function: process_create

    Synopsis: Creates a subprocess and returns a PROCESS identifying the new
    process.  Optionally directs standard input, output, and error streams
    to specified devices.  The caller can also specify environment symbols
    that the subprocess can access.  Accepts these arguments:
    <Table>
    filename    File to execute; if bare filename, searches PATH.
    argv_[]     List of arguments; argv [0] is filename; ends in a NULL.
    workdir     Working directory; if NULL, remains in current directory.
    std_in      Device to use for standard input; NULL = no redirection.
    std_out     Device to use for standard output; NULL = no redirection.
    std_err     Device to use for standard error; NULL = no redirection.
    envs_[]     List of environment symbols to define, or NULL.
    wait        Wait for process to end
    </Table>
    If argv is NULL, parses the filename argument into words delimited by

    be run with the interpreter specified in the first line (EXTPROC line,
    or "'/'*!" line; or failing that with the default command interpreter.
    Under Unix, Windows, and OS/2 this function is implemented using the
    process_create_full() function.

    Known bugs: when parsing filename argument into words, does not handle
    quotes in any special way; "this text" is 2 words, '"this' and 'text"'.
    You should have passed the filename through process_esc() before adding
    any optional arguments.

    Synopsis: Converts the process from an interactive foreground process
    into a background process.  Depending on the system either the existing
    process becomes a background process, or a new process is started as
    a background process and the existing process terminates.

    Requires the original command-line arguments as passed to the main()
    function.  If a new process is started, any arguments that match any
    of the values in the (NULL terminated) 'sswitch' array will be omitted
    from the arguments to the new process.  You should specify the
    command-line switch(es) your main program uses to run as a background
    service.   If it returns, returns 0 if okay, and returns -1 if there
    was an error.

    The precise effect of this function depends on the system.  On UNIX,
    does this:
    <LIST>
    Switches the process to run as a background job, under init;
    closes all open files;
    moves to a safe, known working directory, if required;
    sets the umask for new files;
    opens stdin, stdout, and stderr to the null device;
    enforces exclusive execution through a lock file, if required;
    logs the process id in the lock file;
    ignores the hangup unwanted signals.
    </LIST>
    On OS/2, starts a new copy of the program up, detached, and running
    separately from the current process, and if successful, the existing
    process exits.

    On other systems does nothing except return 0.

    Function: process_alarm

    Synopsis: Sets a system timer to raise a SIGALRM after a specified
    interval in milliseconds.  Returns TRUE if the timer could be created
    and FALSE if there were insufficient resources, or if the system does
    not support timers.  Permits a single alarm for the current process:
    any alarm that was still pending when you called this function is
    annulled.  The implementation is system-dependent and highly
    non-portable.

    Under UNIX we use the setitimer() system function, which is clean and
    simple.

    BeOS does not support this, so we use the good old alarm() function.

    Under 16-bit Windows we use the SetTimer() call.  This does not work
    in 32-bit console applications.  Under 32-bit Windows we use the
    'multimedia' timer, which provides better resolution and does work
    in console applications. In both these cases we cache the id of the
    last-created alarm (and kill it before each new request), to avoid
    multiple active alarms.  It is not a good idea to create too many
    concurrent timers; after 16 or so the alarms start to fail.  This is
    not supposed to happen with MM timers, but does anyway.  Under
    Windows, SIGALRM does not exist.  Since signal() only accepts one of
    a small set of fixed signals, we hijack the SIGFPE signal...  It's a
    compromise and requires that any code which expects a SIGALRM does
    not use SIGFPE.  This can be tweaked in prelude.h.

    Under OS/2 we use the alarm() function which is accurate to one
    second only.  The required accuracy of timing is not easily
    achieved, so process_alarm() rounds down to whole seconds (except if
    rounding down would give 0, in which case it will delay 1 second).
    This will probably cause problems in code applications that depends
    on sub-second timing resolution.

    Under OpenVMS 7 and later we use the setitimer() function as for
    UNIX.  Under OpenVMS 6 and earlier we use the alarm() function as
    for OS/2.  This code may be tuned to use native VMS system calls.

    Function: process_esc

    Synopsis: Escapes a directory string so that process_create() can handle
    it correctly.  If you pass a command to process_create with a directory
    name that contains spaces, it will assume that the spaces delimit the
    command from its arguments.  For instance, under Windows 95, the filename
    "C:\Program Files\Myprog.exe" will be incorrectly treated as a program
    called "C:\Program" with arguments "Files\Myprog.exe".  This function
    replaces spaces by the escape character (0x1B).  You cannot use this
    value in a filename and expect process_create() to work correctly.  On
    an EBCDIC system, the escape character (0x27) is also used.  If the
    dest argument is NULL, allocates a string using mem_alloc() and returns
    that.  Otherwise copies into the dest string and returns that.  If the
    src string is NULL, returns an empty string.
