MODULE: GSL/thrd package

    Class: Thread
    
        Function: thread . parse (command,[error])
            Parses the command, placing any error message in the parameter     
            'error'. Errors can also be recovered via thread class attributes. 
            If successful, returns an object of type 'parsed item' which can   
            then be run as many times as necessary, saving the need to re-parse
            each time.                                                         

        Function: thread . new (command,[error])
            Parses and runs the command, placing any error message in the     
            parameter 'error'. Errors can also be recovered via thread class  
            and child thread object attributes. If the parsing was successful,
            returns an object of type 'child thread'.                         

        Function: thread . sleep (csecs)
            Puts the current thread to sleep for the specified number of
            centiseconds. Returns -1 if csecs is invalid.               

        Function: thread . receive ([receive])
            Receives a message from the thread's message queue. If the queue is
            empty, the thread sleeps until a message is available. Places a    
            reference to the sending thread in the first parameter. Places     
            arbitrary values from the message into successive parameters.      


    Class: Thread
    
        Function: <remote thread> . send ()
            Sends a message with an arbitrary number of arguments to the
            thread.                                                     


    Class: Thread
    
        Function: <child thread> . interrupt ()
            Shuts down the thread.

        Function: <child thread> . send ()
            Sends a message with an arbitrary number of arguments to the
            thread.                                                     


    Class: Thread
    
        Function: <parsed item> . run ([error])
