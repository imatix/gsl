MODULE: GSL/XML package

    Class: XML
    
        Function: XML . new ([name])
            Creates a free 'unattached' XML item. In reality it is attached to
            the global variable ancestor, but only so that GSL can de-allocate
            it on termination. Therefore if the GSL script does not deallocate
            the item, it will remain until GSL shuts down.                    

        Function: XML . load_string (string,[error])
            Loads the supplied string as an XML item. Returns a pointer to the
            (first) resulting XML item or undefined if there was an error. In 
            the latter case, an error message is placed in the parameter      
            'error' and in the XML thread context.                            

        Function: XML . load_file (filename,[error])
            Loads the file with the supplied name as an XML item. Returns a    
            pointer to the (first) resulting XML item or undefined if there was
            an error. In the latter case, an error message is placed in the    
            parameter 'error' and in the XML thread context.                   


    Class: XML item
    
        Function: <XML item> . deleted ()
            Returns TRUE if the XML item has been deleted.

        Function: <XML item> . prev ()
            Returns the previous XML item.

        Function: <XML item> . string ()
            Returns the XML item formatted as a string.

        Function: <XML item> . load_string (string,[error])
            Loads the supplied string as a child of the item. Returns a pointer
            to the (first) resulting XML item or undefined if there was an     
            error. In the latter case, an error messa ge is placed in the      
            parameter 'error' and in the XML thread context.                   

        Function: <XML item> . load_file (filename,[error])
            Loads the file with the supplied name as a child of the item.      
            Returns a pointer to the (first) resulting XML item or undefined if
            there was an error. In the latter case, an error message is placed 
            in the parameter 'error' and in the XML thread context.            

        Function: <XML item> . save (filename,[error])
            Saves the XML item to a file with the given name. Any file errors 
            are places in the parameter 'error' and in the XML thread context.
            Returns zero if no error occurred, errno otherwise.
