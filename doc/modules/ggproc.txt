    Class: Process
    
        Function: proc . new (command,[workdir],[inname],[outname],[errname])
            Creates a process object. The command is a native system command.
            Does not execute the command. The `command` argument names a file
            to execute along with possible arguments. The command will be    
            searched for in the directories specified by the PATH environment
            variable. If `workdir` is provided, a chdir will be performed    
            before the process is run. If `inname`, `outname`, `errname` are 
            provided, the stdin, stdout, and stderr for the process will be  
            respectively redirected to the named files. Returns the process  
            object.
